The origins of flavour mixing go back to the 1960s, when the Italian physicist Cabibbo resolved anomalies in data of weak interactions by proposing a flavour mixing of left-handed down-type quarks. Later in 1973, Kobayaski and Maskawa extended this idea to three quark generations to explain CP violation \cite{Griffiths}. On a mathematical level, quark flavour mixing arises from the fact that the fermion mass eigenstates do not necessarily coincide with the flavour eigenstates. In the course of this chapter we first derive how the Higgs mechanism gives mass to particles and second take a look at fermion masses and why this leads to flavour mixing. The following calculations are based on the outlines in \cite[Chapter 20]{Peskin} and \cite[Chapter 1.2.1]{Tevatron}.
