\section*{Abstract}
Quark flavour mixing is often neglected because of its small effects. But since dark matter only interacts weakly with baryonic matter, these tiny effects might be of importance for direct detection. This thesis examines whether flavour mixing was rightfully neglected by Altmannshofer et. al. in the discussion of a new interaction \cite{Z}. Therefore, we expand an existing framework for dark matter direct detection with the CKM mixing matrix. In the second part of this thesis, we present the new interaction, that was originally proposed to explain anomalies in the decay $B\rightarrow Kl\bar{l}$, but also makes predictions about the direct detection of dark matter. However, when treating dark matter cross sections, this new set-up ignores flavour mixing effects. Thus, we compare those new cross sections with cross sections obtained with flavour mixing and conclude that, in this case, flavour mixing was rightfully neglected.
